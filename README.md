Internship Seattle API Data Homework

In Technology data is key in making critical decisions and having too little or duplicate data may generate mislead reports. 
Using the City of Seattle's API, https://data.seattle.gov, develop a process for continually polling/ collecting available dataset(s).

Itâ€™s not enough just to have rich data, but you must able to quickly visualize in meaning full way. Use the data previously collected 
to create visualizations.

I decided to use the Seattle Traffic Camera's Report to demonstrate my thought process ability in creating a visualization for data. 
Here is a link to the mab-based visualization for this report, http://students.washington.edu/csb206/NordstromHW/.
